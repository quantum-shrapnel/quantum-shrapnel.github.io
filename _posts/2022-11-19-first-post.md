I have a devlog now! Woah!<!--more-->

I want to make an open-source social art gallery platform thing. Basically trying to build a new deviantart from scratch using my programming experience and the many years complaining about things I don't like about other art sites. How successful will this be? Who can say. But I'm going to spend the dwindling moments of 2022 figuring out what features I want and putting together a game plan.
