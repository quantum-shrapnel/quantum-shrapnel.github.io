<hr />

<p>My prospective new years resolution for 2023 is to learn how to use golang. Because I’m awful at programming things I don’t actually want or need, my practice project is going to be something way more complicated than it should be.

I want to make an open-source social art gallery platform thing. Basically trying to build a new deviantart from scratch using my programming experience and the many years complaining about things I don’t like about other art sites. How successful will this be? Who can say. But I’m going to spend the dwindling moments of 2022 figuring out what features I want and putting together a game plan.</p>]]></content><author><name>Quantum Shrapnel</name></author><category term="personal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a devlog now!
